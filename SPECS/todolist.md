# Karl TODO

## Current priorities

- runbook blocker: select-like concurrency primitive (wait on channel/task/timer in one construct)
- runbook blocker: structured errors (kind/code/data) + consistent propagation/recovery patterns
- runbook blocker: guaranteed cleanup primitive (`defer`/`finally`)
- runbook blocker: first-class time/duration ergonomics (durations, deadlines, timeout composition)
- runbook blocker: safer optional access ergonomics (avoid missing-property footguns in workflows)
- runbook blocker: durable state/checkpoint API for crash-safe resume
- runbook blocker: scheduler/trigger runtime (cron, interval, event/webhook)
- runbook blocker: complete I/O primitives (env, argv/stdin scan, fs, process exec, http client/server)
- runbook blocker: secrets/config boundary with redaction-safe error/log behavior
- runbook blocker: observability API (structured logs, step events, metrics, correlation IDs)
- handle ENV vars
- read from command-line (input / scanner)
- add a httpServer built-in
- build a debugger (breakpoints, step in/over/out, stack/locals inspection; CLI first, DAP later)
- build a notebook system for Karl like Jupyter using the repl server
- add binary data support
- change divide-by-zero semantics: raise runtime error instead of returning Inf/NaN
- Keep tests green as syntax/runtime changes land (`gotest`).
- Parser: consider treating newlines as statement boundaries to reduce adjacency ambiguity.
- Extend test coverage when new syntax is added (parser + interpreter + examples).
- Brainstorm objects versus maps versus mutability versus shapes
- Recover block that run for any situation where the runtime throws an expection? ✅
- string interpolation
- make a <task> cancelable ✅


## Known review points

- Disambiguation rules (block vs object) must stay consistent with examples and tests ✅
- Import/factory behavior and live exports should remain explicit in specs.
