## 🎨 What Gets Highlighted

### Keywords (Purple/Blue)
`let`, `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `match`, `case`, `wait`, `then`, `with`

### Async Operators (RED - Stand Out!)
- `&` - Spawn task
- `|` - Race tasks

### Arrow Functions (Yellow)
`->`

### Strings (Green/Orange)
`"hello"`, `'world'`

### Numbers (Green)
`42`, `3.14`, `0xFF`

### Built-in Functions (Cyan/Teal)
`log`, `http`, `map`, `rendezvous`, `filter`, `send`, `recv`, `then`

### Comments (Gray Italic)
`// this is a comment`

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Comment Toggle**
Select lines and press `Cmd+/` (Mac) or `Ctrl+/` (Windows) to toggle comments

### 2. **Bracket Matching**
Click a bracket `{` `[` `(` and its pair lights up!

### 3. **Auto-Close**
Type `{` and it automatically adds `}` - same for `"`, `'`, `[`, `(`

### 4. **Theme Selection**
Try different themes for different looks:
- `Cmd+K, Cmd+T` to open theme picker
- Try: **One Dark Pro**, **Dracula**, **Nord**

### 5. **Custom Colors**
Edit your `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "textMateRules": [
      {
        "scope": "keyword.operator.async.karl",
        "settings": { "foreground": "#FF0000", "fontStyle": "bold" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 🎭 Before & After

### BEFORE (no extension):
```
let task = & http({ method: "GET", url: "..." })
let result = wait task
```
*Everything looks the same - boring monotone!*

### AFTER (with extension):
```
let task = & http({ method: "GET", url: "..." })
let result = wait task
```
*Now with:*
- `let` highlighted as keyword
- `&` standing out as async operator
- `http` as built-in function
- Strings in color
- `wait` as control keyword

**Your code becomes ART!** 🎨

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Not Seeing Colors?

**Solution 1:** Reload VS Code window
- `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Reload Window"

**Solution 2:** Check file extension
- File must end in `.k`
- Bottom right of VS Code should say "Karl"

**Solution 3:** Verify installation
```bash
ls ~/.vscode/extensions/ | grep karl
# Should show: karl-lang-0.1.0
```

**Solution 4:** Check language mode
- Bottom right corner → click language
- Select "Karl" from the list

---

## 📦 Sharing the Extension

### Create VSIX for others:

```bash
cd karl-vscode
npm install
npm install -g vsce
vsce package
```

This creates `karl-lang-0.1.0.vsix`

Share it with others:
```bash
# They can install with:
code --install-extension karl-lang-0.1.0.vsix
```
