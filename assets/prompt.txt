A clean, geometric sans-serif font would best match the style you described for the “Karl” logo. Fonts that fit this aesthetic include:

Futura Bold – precise geometry and strong presence
Montserrat Extra Bold – modern, balanced, and highly legible
Poppins SemiBold – rounded geometry that complements slick shapes
Nexa Bold – sharp edges and a technical feel
